# Dive into Deep Learning

I am organizing a deep learning reading group in Summer 2021. We are reading the <a href="https://d2l.ai/">Dive into Deep Learning</a> book together. In this repository, I will share the exercises that I solve as part of this reading group.

The chapters that we read each week are as follows.

**Week 1**: Chapters 2 (Preliminaries) & 3 (Linear Neural Networks)

| Week | Contents  |
| :-----: | :-: |
| Week 1 | Chapter 2 (Preliminaries)| 
|        | Chapter 3 (Linear Neural Networks)|
| Week 2 | Chapter 4 (Multilayer Perceptrons)| 
|        | Chapter 5 (Deep Learning Computation)|
